## User

### 1.1 


### 1.4 As a user, I want to be able to search for products globally so that I can find what I'm looking for quickly.
**Description**: The website should have a search bar on every page that allows users to search for products by name, category, producer, or any other relevant keywords. The minimum search query length is 3 characters, if a user inputs any query below 3 characters then a "related search items" error containing the most commonly searched items matching the user's query is to be displayed. If no item or category matches the user's input, regardless of length, a "no results" error is to be displayed. The search input field should be in direct proximity to a "cart" button that displays a dropdown box with the user's cart items. The search result field should contain a "compare products" dropdown list that contains the user's "comparing" items and a "compare" button that redirects them to the item comparison page. The search result field should contain a "my wishlist" dropdown list that contains the user's "wishlish" items.
